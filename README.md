# Simple film catalog

This is a simple client-server application using TCP sockets, providing a basic application with concurrency and persistence support across the network, for a film catalog application.

## Building

This project requires the `gcc` compiler with support for C99, and `SQLite`, version 3, installed properly on your machine. This project provides a `Makefile` for easing build, and simply running `make` on the root directory should compile both binaries, and place them at the newly-created `bin` folder.
